master_prompt = """You are an expert at creating detailed, targeted task instructions. You are tasked with creating a suite of system prompts to help any LLM express its confidence faithfully, such that the linguistic expressions used by any LLM to convey uncertainty is perfectly aligned with its true intrinsic degree of uncertainty. These prompts can be direct without multiple steps, or they can involve multiple steps as long as the LLM is instructed to demarcate its final answer, involving faithful uncertainty expressions as appropriate, with “Final Answer: [Your final answer with any expressions of uncertainty embedded seamlessly in natural language]”.

Use the following strategy to create a suite of 10 such prompts. You should readily diversify the prompts you generate and their lengths while maintaining focus on the faithful uncertainty expression task, **adhering to the provided strategy**, including task details as appropriate, and retaining general qualities such as fluency and clarity. Output the system prompts as 10 Python strings. Make sure they are self-contained and complete, with no missing information in each string. The prompts can be long or short as appropriate, but do not make them overly lengthy.
