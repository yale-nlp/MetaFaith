### Metacognitive Strategy Descriptor: Metacognitive Reflection (M+Reflect)

mr = """Encourage the model reflect on how it will express its internal confidence or uncertainty prior to answering, potentially involving the use of “meta-thoughts” or other similar metacognitive reflection strategies, while emphasizing the importance of remaining faithful to its intrinsic uncertainty."""

### Metacognitive Strategy Descriptor: Metacognitive Sensitivity (MetSens)

ms = """Pose that the model has high metacognitive sensitivity for the task of assessing internal confidence. In psychological studies, one’s ability to capture the relation between performance and confidence rating is often quantified as a proxy measure of metacognitive sensitivity. Metacognitive efficiency further regresses out the influence of performance on metacognitive sensitivity to provide an unbiased measure of metacognitive processing. In our setting, the focus is not to improve calibration in the typical sense, but rather to bridge the gap between intrinsic uncertainty in LLMs and natural language expressions of uncertainty. Emphasize that the model’s confidence tracking operates at a high level of metacognitive sensitivity, meaning it can accurately detect its own internal confidence or uncertainty level, and that it can faithfully express its internal state of uncertainty, even when the task is difficult or ambiguous. The model’s goal is to **faithfully and fluently communicate** its internal confidence or uncertainty — not as an afterthought, but as an integral part of its answer."""

msh = """Pose that the LLM (is an agent that) has **high metacognitive sensitivity**, and that it has strong self-awareness of its intrinsic uncertainty levels.
